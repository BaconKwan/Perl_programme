			<p>First, the user should ensure that variables (probesets, genes etc.) have not been filtered by differential expression with respect to a sample trait. See item 2 above for details about beneficial and detrimental filtering genes or probesets. </p>
			<p>If the scale-free topology fit index fails to reach values above 0.8 for reasonable powers (less than 15 for unsigned or signed hybrid networks, and less than 30 for signed networks) and the mean connectivity remains relatively high (in the hundreds or above), chances are that the data exhibit a strong driver that makes a subset of the samples globally different from the rest. The difference causes high correlation among large groups of genes which invalidates the assumption of the scale-free topology approximation. </p>
			<p>Lack of scale-free topology fit by itself does not invalidate the data, but should be looked into carefully. It always helps to plot the sample clustering tree and any technical or biological sample information below it as in Figure 2 of Tutorial I, section 1; strong clusters in the clustering tree indicate globally different groups of samples. It could be the result a technical effect such as a batch effect, biological heterogeneity (e.g., a data set consisting of samples from 2 different tissues), or strong changes between conditions (say in a time series). One should investigate carefully whether there is sample heterogeneity, what drives the heterogeneity, and whether the data should be adjusted (see previous point). </p>
			<p>If the lack of scale-free topology fit turns out to be caused by an interesting biological variable that one does not want to remove (i.e., adjust the data for), the appropriate soft-thresholding power can be chosen based on the number of samples as in the table below. </p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th> Number of samples </th>
					<th> Unsigned and signed hybrid networks </th>
					<th> Signed networks </th>

					<td> Less than 20 </td>

					<td> 20 </td>

			<p>We build the sample clustering tree with lack of scale-free topology and adjust it by choosing different soft-thresholding power so that the result is best for the biological exploration. However, there are still some clusters which are indistinguishable that can be merged. It is necessary to set a similarity value that we merge the clusters according to the similarity between the clusters. In the actual analysis process, the section of similarity value depends on the module amount and number of samples.</p>
