			<p>Probesets or genes may be filtered by mean expression or variance (or their robust analogs such as median and median absolute deviation, MAD) since low-expressed or non-varying genes usually represent noise. Whether it is better to filter by mean expression or variance is a matter of debate; both have advantages and disadvantages, but more importantly, they tend to filter out similar sets of genes since mean and variance are usually related.</p>
			<p>We do not recommend filtering genes by differential expression. WGCNA is designed to be an unsupervised analysis method that clusters genes based on their expression profiles. Filtering genes by differential expression will lead to a set of correlated genes that will essentially form a single (or a few highly correlated) modules. It also completely invalidates the scale-free topology assumption, so choosing soft thresholding power by scale-free topology fit will fail. </p>
			<p>In a word, we filter genes which are not expressed in more than half of the samples. Similarly, we filter samples of which more than half of the genes are not expressed.</p>
